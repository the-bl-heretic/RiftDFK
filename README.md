# RiftDFK (Dynamic Force Kernel)

Welcome to RiftDFK!

This is a modular physics engine designed for dynamic force simulations in Unity.  
Inspired by the chaos and creativity of games like Bonelab, RiftDFK gives you control over custom physical behaviors.

# How To Use RiftDFK

- RiftDFK is a simple yet advanced s-u-v-a-t Physics Engine. (Currently in **1.1.8 Beta**)
- Please go to [the wiki](https://your-link-here.com) to install RiftDFK


## Rift Kernel

- The **Rift Kernel** is a critical part of your project. Without it, the physics engine would collapse into uncoordinated movements.
- To place the Rift Kernel, first open the **Rift Portal**.
- The Rift Portal includes all required and optional tools.
- Make sure you have **nothing selected** in the Hierarchy!  
  (If something is selected, the Rift Kernel will be placed on the selected object, which is **not** recommended.)
- When you're ready, click **Initialize Rift Kernel**.  
  This will create a new GameObject in the scene with only a **Rift Kernel** component (and a standard **Transform**).
